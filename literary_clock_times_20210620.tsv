04:04	Four minutes after four! It's still very early and to get from here to there won't take me more than 15 minutes, even walking slowly. She told me around five o'clock. Wouldn't it be better to wait on the corner?	Angel Hill	Cirilo Villaverde

04:06	Dexter looked at Kate's note, then her face, then the clock. It was 4.06am, the night before they would go to the restaurant.	The Expats	Chris Pavone
04:07	4.07am. Why am I standing? My shoulders feel cold and I'm shivering. I become aware that I'm standing in the middle of the room. I immediately look at the bedroom door. Closed, with no signs of a break-in. Why did I get up?	Guarding Hanna	Miha Mazzini

04:09	'He's right upstairs… Oh ye gods! Illya!' He looked at his watch. It was nine minutes past four. 'He's sitting in the middle of an ultrasonic field upstairs. and I'm ten minutes late to get him out. Come on!'	The Final Affair: A 'Man from U.N.C.L.E' Novel	David McDaniel
04:10	When I woke up in bed again, I was in the midst of the panic I had been in just before dying.

04:24	At 04:24 on January 5, 2025, the stars stood still in the sky. In California, the earthquake started with a low- frequency rumble. It wasn't a sound but a sensation that caused an incomprehensible weakness in the legs, a constriction of the bowels, and panic.	Perfect Circle	Carlos J Cortes
04:25	As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four.	The Man with the Twisted Lip	Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
04:26	At twenty-six minutes past four, she was pronounced dead. Cause of death, or rather manner of death, was apparent. There were two bullet wounds of entry in her chest.	If You Really Loved Me	Ann Rule
04:27	Bad footballers blame the pitch. And then I heard the school bell in my dream but it wasnt really a school bell and the pitch went very steep like a trap door opening and I fell and landed in bed. It was still dark and my alarm clock said 04:27 and I heard the noise again.	The Dead Fathers Club	Matt Haig
04:28	He had been the only survivor—the only one who'd come home alive. So what the hell was going on? Who was this new character in his nightmares? He glanced up at the clock and was disheartened to discover that it was only 0428 hours.	Solfleet: The Call of Duty	Glenn Smith
04:29	'Your pardon, Dr. Leving, but there is an urgent call for you. The pseudo-robot Caliban says he must speak with you at once.' Fredda sighed.

'It is now 0429 hours,' Donald said.	Utopia	Roger MacBride Allen

04:36	At 4:36 that morning, alone in my hotel room, it had been a much better scene. Spencer had blanched, confounded by the inescapable logic of my accusation. A few drops of perspiration had formed on his upper lip. A tiny vein had started to throb in his temple.	The Brass Go-Between	Ross Thomas
04:37	Shaw laughed, apologized, and said he hoped that was true. He draped his kit over his head and snapped it in. Checked his watch. It was 0437 hours.	Knife	Ross Ritchell
04:38	At 4.38 a.m. as the sun is coming up over Gorley Woods, I hear a strange rustling in the grass beside me. I peer closely but can see nothing.	The Queue	Jonathan Barrow
04:39	At zero hour minus one minute, twenty-one minutes to five on March the twenty-first , Jiffy Tripp stood in the trenches beside an infantry officer, looking over no man's land.

God's Sparrows	Philip Child
04:40	I settled into a daily routine. Wake up at 4.40am, shower, get on the train north by ten after five.	Bossypants	Tina Fey
04:41	At 4:41 Crane's voice crackled through the walkie-talkie as if he'd read their thoughts of mutiny. 'Everyone into the elevator. Now!' Only moments before the call he and C.J. had finished what they hoped would be a successful diversion.	Damaged Goods	Roland S. Jefferson
04:42	A large clock above the desks read, 04:42 am. He paused to listen. Whatever had happened there, appeared to be over.	Dead City	Matthew Warwick

04:44	'At 0444 hours yesterday morning, the landing craft Orpheus was appropriated by Dr. Diana Chandler, twenty-seven, an astrophysicist from Toronto, Canada. Dr. Chandler, apparently disconsolate over the failure of her husband, Aaron Rossman, also twenty-seven, also of Toronto, to renew their recently expired two-year marriage contract, presumably committed suicide. Mr. Rossman is the Starcology's dock master.'	Golden Fleece	Robert J. Sawyer
04:45	His wife's breathing at his side is so faint that he can scarcely hear it. One of these mornings she'll be lying dead beside me and I won't even notice, he thinks. Or maybe it'll be me. Daybreak will reveal that one of us has been left alone. He checks the clock on the table next to the bed. The hands glow and register 4:45 a.m.	Faceless Killers	Henning Mankell
04:46	The sun had risen at 04.46 and would not set until 21.26, and I'm not sure if there was a moon or not. At any rate I would not again be witness to that warm suspended light nor hear the bells pealing out inconsiderately as evening fell.	All Souls	Javier Marías

04:52	'I'm Carol Manning. This is Captain Willet.'<br>'What time is it?'<br>'If it matters, it's eight minutes to five. Don't get any persecuted ideas that I enjoy being out of bed at this time of night. It makes it legally easier if you invite us in.'	Holding the Zero	Gerald Seymour

04:56	And I was tired and out of cigarettes and still feeling a little hungover. The clock on the VCR was telling me it was four minutes to five in the morning. That just made it all seem even more surreal.	A Fistful of Rain	Greg Rucka
04:57	The second said the same thing a few minutes before five, and mentioned eternity... I'm sure I'll meet you in the other world. Four minutes later she left a last, fleeting message: My love.

04:58	He wants to look death in the face. Two minutes to five. I took a handkerchief out of my pocket, but John Dawson ordered me to put it back. An Englishman dies with his eyes open. He wants to look death in the face.	Dawn	Elie Wiesel
04:59	The whole place smells like death no matter what the fuck you do. Gately gets to the shelter at 0459.9h and just shuts his head off as if his head had a control switch.	Infinite Jest	David Foster Wallace
05:00	The day came slow, till five o'clock<br>Then sprang before the hills<br>Like hindered rubies, or the light<br>A sudden musket spills	 	Emily Dickinson
05:01	Just after five o'clock on this chill September morning, the fishmonger's cart, containing Kirsten and Emilia and such possessions as they have been able to assemble in the time allowed to them, is driven out of the gates of Rosenborg?	Music & Silence	Rose Tremain

05:04	Oh yes. His clocks were set at one minute past five, four minutes past five and seven minutes past five. That was the combination number of a safe, 515457. The safe was concealed behind a reproduction of the Mona Lisa. Inside the safe, continued Poirot, with distaste, 'were the Crown Jewels of the Russian Royal Family.'	The Clocks	Agatha Christie
05:05	The baby, a boy, is born at five past five in the morning.	The Namesake	Jhumpa Lahiri
05:06	5:06 a.m. I wake up strangely energized, my stomach growling. Upstairs, the overstocked fridge offers me its bounty of sympathy food.	This Is Where I Leave You	Jonathan Tropper
05:07	His feet slammed into the ground; Ron staggered into him and he fell over; the Portkey hit the ground near his head with a heavy thud. Harry looked up. Mr Weasley, Mr Diggory and Cedric were still standing, though looking very windswept; everybody else was on the ground. ‘Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill,’ said a voice.	Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire	J. K. Rowling
05:08	... and Ambrose and I will marry at Fort McHenry at 5.08 EDST this coming Saturday, Rosh Hashanah!	Letters	John Barth

Slummer's Paradise	Herbert Asbury
05:13	Lying on my side in bed, I stared at my alarm clock until it became a blemish, its red hue glowing like a welcome sign beckoning me into the depths of hell's crimson-colored cavities. 5:13 am. To describe this Monday as a blue Monday was an understatement.	Uptempo	Nakia D. Johnson
05:14	The time was 5.14am, a very strange time indeed for the sheriff to have seen what he claimed he saw as he made his early-morning rounds, first patrolling back and forth along the deserted, snowbound streets of Kingdom City before extending his vigilance northward, along County Road.	Into the Web	Thomas H. Cook
05:15	Weird conversation with Brown, a tired & confused old man who's been jerked out of bed at 5:15.	Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72	Hunter S. Thompson

05:21	'On the morning of the ninth instant, that is to say, yesterday, at twenty-one minutes past five o'clock in the morning, P.C.

05:24	... ending exactly as it melted into 5:24, then when she woke she would love me and not say this had been a terrible mistake.	The Tragedy of Arthur	Arthur Phillips
05:25	George's train home from New Street leaves at 5.25. On the return journey, there are rarely schoolboys.	Arthur & George	Julian Barnes
05:26	I think this is actually bump number 1,970. And the boy keeps plugging away at the same speed. There isn't a sound from them. Not a moan. Poor them. Poor me. I look at the clock. 05:26.	101 Reykjavik	Hallgrímur Helgason
05:27	The tempo of the Cuban barrage suddenly picked up—shells seemed to be raining down at the rate of three or four a minute. At the sound, the South African officers looked up from their maps and discussion. Boerson checked his watch: 0527 hours. A little early, he thought, but the Cubans probably plan to give us one hell of a pasting before they attack. Wonderful.	Vortex	Larry Bond
05:28	I pulled into the Aoyama supermarket parking garage at five-twenty-eight. The sky to the east was getting light. I entered the store carrying my bag. Almost no one was in the place. A young clerk in a striped uniform sat reading a magazine; a woman of indeterminate age was buying a cartload of cans and instant food. I turned past the liquor display and went straight to the snack bar.	Hard Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World	Haruki Murakami
05:29	It was twenty-nine minutes past five, according to the red devilish numbers on the alarm clock, and she was being broken into.	The Brightest Star in the Sky	Marian Keyes
05:30	For instance, it is half-past five in the summer morning. Young Chase's narrow bachelor bed has evidently been slept in, for it is rumpled in that barely disturbed way which can never be counterfeited. His jug's empty and there's grey water in the basin, cleanly boy. The window is open, admitting the salubrious sea-breeze. He doesn't smoke anyway. What an innocent room it is.	An Insular Possession	Timothy Mo

05:32	By 05.32 the driver had come back from a corner shop with a six-pack of Coke, a bottle of Jack Daniels, some sachets of breakfast milk, an armful of stale cakes and a carton of Zhongncmhai cigarettes. The doors slammed shut and the van moved off.	Rare Earth	Paul Mason
05:33	The next few stills showed them moving along the corridor, stopping at Hansen's door, the door opening although Hansen was out of view, and then, again, a blank corridor.

05:38	It was now 0538 hours on the same day, Monday, December 21 and still dark. U-31 was sailing on the surface at fifteen knots.

05:39	George took his phone from the dressing table. 'The nightmare beat the alarm by just over an hour,' he said. 'It's twenty-one minutes to six.'<br>'Let me catch some more sleep,' she said groggily. 'And let me bath and make you some breakfast.'<br>'That's music to my ears. Don't forget that I'm three-in-one. I'll need to take some of your delicious cooking to work.'<br>'How can I forget that there are four of us now?'	The E Utopia Project	Kudakwashe Muzira
05:40	Twenty minutes to six. 'Rob's boys were already on the platform, barrows ready. The only thing that ever dared to be late around here was the train.

05:46	Herbert could feel nothing. He wrote a legal-sounding phrase to the effect that the sentence had been carried out at 5.46am, adding, 'without a snag'. The burial party had cursed him quietly as they'd hacked at the thick roots and tight soil.	A Whispered Name	William Brodrick
05:47	His eyelids pried open. The bedside lamp was lit. Rue hovered over him, flicking her finger at his earlobe. What the hell? The clock said it was forty-seven minutes past five. Before dawn. On a Sunday.	Christmas Coverup	Cassie Miles

05:50	He paced the wooden boards and looked again,—ten minutes to six. Then he stopped suddenly. Along that gleaming stretch of private road came a car, driven at a rapid pace. Prince Shan stood and watched it, and as he watched, it seemed almost as though the hidden sun had caught his face and transfigured it.	The Great Prince Shan	E. Phillips Oppenheim
05:51	It was nine minutes to six o'clock and an hour before dawn. The brigade was not due to move today, and so, just as they did every other day, along with every British corps in the field, the four battalions stood to arms in case of attack. Each company paraded and then marched to form with its battalion at its alarm post. The time just before dawn was when men felt low in spirits and drowsy, making it a good time for the enemy to attack.	Whose Business is to Die	Adrian Goldsworthy

05:55	It was 5.55am and raining hard when I pedalled up to the bike stand just outside the forecourt of the station and dashed inside. I raced past the bookstall, where all the placards of the Yorkshire Post (a morning paper) read 'York Horror', but also 'Terrific February Gales at Coast'.	The Lost Luggage Porter	Andrew Martin
05:56	He pulled out his own. The officer with the chipped nose went over to borrow the watch of General Feraud. They bent their heads over them for a time. 'That's it. At four minutes to six by yours. 	A Set of Six	Joseph Conrad
05:57	He drank his coffee and ate his rolls with an excellent appetite, and then he glanced at his chronometer. It was three minutes to six—time he went across to the barge.	The Red Cross Barge	Marie Belloc Lowndes
05:58	Annika Giannini woke with a start. She saw that it was 5.58 a.m. …	The Girl Who Kicked The Hornets' Nest	Stieg Larsson

06:00	I had risen half-an-hour before her entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.

06:09	_6:09 a.m._ Annabel Reade listens to the alarm under her pillow. In the dim light of the bedroom she sees the paging signal blinking softly on the computer screen. Jasper is calling her, tapping out the opening lines of her favorite book, _Animal Farm_.	Running Wild	J. G. Ballard
06:10	The bus left the station at ten past six - and she sat proud, like an accustomed traveller, apart from her father, John Henry, and Berenice.

06:11	This was at 06:11 and three minutes later I saw the front door of Sorgenicht's house open and a figure show up against the light inside.

06:18	Ernest Wilkins woke to the clamour of the alarm.

06:30	Six-thirty was clearly a preposterous time and he, the client, obviously hadn't meant it seriously. A civilised six-thirty for twelve noon was almost certainly what he had in mind, and if he wanted to cut up rough about it, Dirk would have no option but to start handing out some serious statistics.

The Long Dark Tea-time of the Soul	Douglas Adams
06:31	It was now 06:31 and still dark, but the lower ranks who were saddled with the daily task of lighting fires, fetching and heating water and preparing food would soon be up and moving around.	Earth-Thunder	Patrick Tilley

06:33	He got to work. When he pulled up his final calculations, the actual liftoff worked out to 06:33 if they wanted to follow the most optimal course toward transit.

06:36	'Uh, we got a call, at, ummm … 06:36 … and I sent Eight up on it. He got there, and thinks we should, uh, probably have you come up and take a look.'

06:42	It was 06:42 and he'd just finished his solo morning workout: three circuits of Ring 7 – the second-longest ring in the hab-disk – followed by a half hour pushing and pulling against resistance channels in the gym.	Marine Cadet	Tim C. Taylor
06:43	To London on the 6.43am. Jessica is back from her holiday. Things are looking up, she called me Chris, instead of Minister, when we talked on the phone this afternoon.	A View From the Foothills	Chris Mullin

Her mouth was small and proud, her eyes gray and solemn, her color high from walking in the chilly air, and her hair of that nondescript brown usually described as fair.
